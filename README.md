This project is a facebook-like server-client application. A user can create an account, post meesages to other users walls, add friends, and display the contents of their own wall. It is written exclusivly in bash. This project was a collaboration between myself (Diarmaid McKeagney) and Peter Fitzgerald. This project was completed for CT213.
